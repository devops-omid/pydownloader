; Number of parallel connections to use for each download.
; A value between 8 and 16 is usually a good starting point.

; A secret token for securing the RPC connection.
; It's highly recommended to set a strong, random password here.

[schedules]
; Define your bandwidth schedules here.
; The format is: s<number> = HH:MM-HH:MM-SPEED
; The scheduler will use the *first* matching schedule it finds (s1, s2, etc.).

; Example: Limit speed to 2 Megabytes/sec during work hours (9 AM to 5 PM).
s1 = 09:00-17:00-2M

; Example: Allow a faster speed of 8 Megabytes/sec in the evening.
s2 = 17:00-22:00-8M

; Example: Allow full speed overnight (10 PM to 6 AM).
; This is an example of a schedule that spans midnight.
s3 = 22:00-06:00-0
